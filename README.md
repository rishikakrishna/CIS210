# CIS 210
Introduction to Computer Science

**Week 1** <br>
*Memorable PINs* (alphacode.py) Practice sequential programming. Understand numeric representation and modular arithmetic. <br>
*Draw flower using Turtle* (drawflower.py) Practice turtle graphics.
  
**Week 2** <br>
*Counting majors* (counts.py) An exercise in careful loop design with a 'case breakdown' of what should happen on the first iteration, different possibilities in the loop body, and after the last iteration. <br>
*Approximate square root* (squareroot.py) Approximate the square root of a number using iteration.
 
**Week 3** <br>
*Print a Calendar* (calpr.py) This project is to think through a fencepost algorithm: printing the first (partial) week of a month, then the full weeks, then the last (partial) week. <br>
*Draw a postal barcode* (draw_barcode.py) More practice turtle graphics. Nested for loops, lists of lists.
 
**Week 4** <br>
*Word Jumbles (Anagrams)* (jumbler.py) A common programming task is to scan a file, picking out elements that meet some criterion. This assignment introduces the file-scan idiom in Python, along with some basic manipulation of strings (text).
 
**Week 5** <br>
*Recursive string reversal* (string_reverse.py) Recursive implementation of string_reverse(input string) <br>
*Determine set membership* (is_member.py) Recursive implementation of is_member() on a set represented by a sorted list of integers.
 
**Week 6** <br>
*Routing depth-first search* (routes.py) Graph search to find shortest path between two cities..
 
**Week 7** <br>
*Analyzing Earthquake Data* (eqanalysis.py) Analyze and plot earthquake data.
 
**Week 8** <br>
*Sudoku Helper* (sdktactics.py) Tactics and checks for Sudoku.
