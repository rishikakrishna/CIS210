"""
Test harness:
   Utility functions for writing test cases in Python programs.
   
   Python has a standard module, unittest, that provides a more
   powerful but but more complex testing framework. This module
   is designed to be very simple.

	testEQ checks a test case for predicted result
	test_approx checks a test case for approximately predicted result
	testRaise checks a test case for raising an expected exception
